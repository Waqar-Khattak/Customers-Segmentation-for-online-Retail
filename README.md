# Customers-Segmentation-for-online-Retail
This project presents a customer segmentation framework for online retail using RFM analysis and clustering algorithms. It analyzes over 541,000 transactions to identify behavior-based customer groups. Three clustering methods—K-means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN—are evaluated, with K-means yielding the most actionable results.
