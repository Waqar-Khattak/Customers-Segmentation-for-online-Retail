# Customers-Segmentation-for-online-Retail
This project presents a comprehensive approach to customer segmentation in online retail by leveraging behavioral data and unsupervised machine learning techniques. Using over 541,000 transaction records from a UK-based gift retailer, the study focuses on extracting meaningful customer insights through RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis enriched with features like product diversity, purchase timing, and average order value.

Traditional segmentation approaches based on demographics often fail to capture true customer behavior. To address this, the project explores behavior-driven segmentation using three clustering algorithms: K-means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN. The K-means algorithm emerged as the most effective, producing five distinct customer segments with the highest silhouette score (0.306) and business interpretability. These segments were labeled as Champions, Loyal Customers, Former Big Spender, and two groups of Lost Customers, each reflecting unique engagement levels, spending habits, and shopping patterns.

The methodology involves thorough data cleaning, feature engineering, and validation using statistical metrics like the Calinski-Harabasz index and silhouette scores, along with business-centric criteria such as actionability and stability. Exploratory Data Analysis uncovered seasonal and temporal trends, product preferences, and geographical insights that further informed segmentation and marketing recommendations.

Each segment received tailored marketing strategies, including VIP programs for high-value customers, product bundling for exploratory buyers, and re-engagement campaigns for lapsed users. The research provides a clear roadmap from raw data preprocessing to actionable marketing strategies, serving both academic and practical purposes in the retail domain.

Implemented using Python with libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn, the project demonstrates how combining classical RFM analysis with advanced clustering can significantly enhance customer understanding and business outcomes. By shifting from one-size-fits-all marketing to data-driven personalization, this project empowers online retailers to boost retention, loyalty, and revenue through strategic segmentation
